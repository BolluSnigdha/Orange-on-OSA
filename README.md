# 🛒 Online Shopping Analysis - Data Mining Project

This project focuses on analyzing online shopping behavior using data mining techniques. The goal is to uncover hidden patterns and trends in user purchases, preferences, and payment methods to support better decision-making in e-commerce.

## 📌 Project Objective

To perform an in-depth analysis of customer shopping behavior using real-world survey data and generate insights using data preprocessing, transformation, and data mining techniques like association rule mining and classification.

## 📂 Dataset

* The dataset was obtained through a survey on online shopping behavior.
* Key features include:

  * Age, Gender
  * Frequency of shopping
  * Preferred products
  * Payment method
  * Average monthly spending
  * Purchase reasons

Format: `.csv`

## 🧠 Techniques Used

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
* **Categorization of numerical features (e.g., Spending → Price Ranges)**
* **Dimensional Modeling**

  * Star Schema
  * Snowflake Schema
  * Fact Constellation
* **Classification -Gradient Boosting **
* **Visualization using orange tool
* **SQL-based OLAP modeling** (e.g., star schema queries)


## 🔧 Tools and Technologies

* Orange
* Oracle SQL / MySQL
*  Excel
*  VS Code
* SSMS


INSTALL ORANGE 
### 1. Import the Dataset

Ensure the dataset (`ml.csv`) is in the root folder. Load and clean it using the Orange tool.

### 2. Analyze & Visualize

* Use visualizations to see trends like:

  * Most purchased categories
  * Spending habits by age/gender
  * Payment preference distribution
* Apply association rule mining to find frequently bought product groups

### 3. Run SQL Models

Use SQL queries to:

* Create dimension and fact tables
* Populate them using your cleaned dataset
* Run OLAP operations like `ROLLUP`, `CUBE`, and `GROUP BY`

---

## 🏁 Outputs

* Star Schema with 4 dimensions: Customer, Product, Time, Payment
* Cleaned & structured fact table for sales
* Insightful graphs (spending by age, most preferred products, etc.)
* Accuracy for Classification

## 📊 Sample Visualization

Include sample bar charts / pie charts from your Orange
